     *     two events into one malformed XML document on the wire.
     *  3. ~3 CoT every 2s in steady flight is ~2,700 thread creations an hour, on a controller.

     *     IOException and sets an internal flag, so the catch below cannot see a broken pipe,
     *     a half-open socket or a failed flush — it only ever caught something like an NPE.
     *     checkError() is the ONLY way to see that failure, and it also clears nothing, so it
     *     is safe to call on every message.
