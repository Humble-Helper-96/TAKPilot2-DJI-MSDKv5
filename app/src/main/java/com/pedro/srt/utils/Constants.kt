   * TAKPILOT2 CHANGE: 1500 -> 1316. This is the SIZING INPUT for an outgoing SRT packet, not
   * the size of one. `SrtSender` takes `MTU - 16` and fits whole 188-byte MPEG-TS packets in
   * it, so what actually goes on the wire is:
   *
   * ```
   *   IP(20) + UDP(8) + SRT(16) + N x 188
   *   N = (MTU - 16) / 188
   *   1500 -> N=7 -> 1360 bytes        1316 -> N=6 -> 1172 bytes
   * ```
   *
   * ⚠ **THE LIBRARY DOES NOT SUBTRACT THE IP AND UDP HEADERS.** libsrt treats its MSS as the
   * whole datagram and takes 28 bytes off for them; this code does not, so 1500 here means
   * 1360 on the wire — larger than an ordinary 1500-byte path allows, before any tunnel.
   *
   * Measured on the fleet controller against the live server, 2026-08-29: the path MTU is
   * **1342 bytes** (1342 passes with DF set, 1343 fails). The 1360-byte packets were refused
   * by the local stack with EMSGSIZE, and because only a LARGE frame fills a datagram to
   * seven TS packets, the stream connected, ran, and then died on a keyframe.
   *
   * 1172 leaves 170 bytes of margin on that path and stays under the worst MTU a cellular or
   * VPN path realistically presents. The cost is one more packet per six: header overhead
   * goes from 3.2% to 3.8%.
