/**
 * Imperial display units for the flight UI. The aircraft and every internal calculation work in
 * metres — conversion happens only at the point of display, so nothing downstream (CoT, DTED,
 * slant-range math) is affected by what the pilot sees.
 *
 * Operator standard is imperial throughout: the Pre-Flight Setup limits are already entered in
 * feet, the altitude readout is feet and speed is MPH, so distances being metres was the odd one
 * out rather than a deliberate choice.
 *
 * ⚠ `Locale.US` on every format call, deliberately. `String.format` with no locale uses the
 * device default, and a comma-decimal locale (most of Europe) or a non-Latin-digit one would
 * turn every readout on the HUD into something a fixed-format ATAK-style pilot display was
 * never built to show — this is a pilot-safety readout, not a locale-aware label.
