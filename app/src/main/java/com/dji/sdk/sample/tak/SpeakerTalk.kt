/**
 * PUSH-TO-TALK through the AS1 speaker: the controller's microphone, live, out of the aircraft.
 *
 * The pipeline is DJI's own, the same one their `MegaphoneVM` sample uses:
 * mic -> [AudioRecordHandler] -> [OpusEncoder] -> `sendRealTimeDataToMegaphone`.
 *
 * ⚠ **PUSH TO TALK, NEVER A TOGGLE, AND THAT IS A SAFETY DECISION** (operator, 2026-08-23). A
 * toggle can leave a HOT MICROPHONE broadcasting from an aircraft over a public area with nobody
 * aware of it — the pilot's own conversation, on a loudspeaker, at whatever range the aircraft
 * happens to be. Every route in and out of this object is therefore a hold: the transmission
 * lives only as long as a finger or a button is down. [stop] is idempotent and safe to call from
 * anywhere, and it is called from the panel closing, the screen pausing and the screen dying, so
 * no path through the application can leave the microphone open.
 *
 * ⚠ THE MICROPHONE IS A SINGLETON. [AudioRecordHandler] is one instance for the process, so a
 * session that did not release cleanly makes the NEXT one fail with the microphone unavailable.
 * [forceRelease] therefore tears down the recorder and the encoder before every start, whatever
 * state this object believes it is in.
 *
 * ⚠ The work mode is left in [WorkMode.REAL_TIME] after a talk. Putting it back would be a write
 * to the payload for no pilot-visible gain, and the next SOUND press sets what it needs anyway.
