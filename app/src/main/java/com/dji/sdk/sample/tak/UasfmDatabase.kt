/**
 * Stores the FAA UAS Facility Map (UASFM) altitude ceilings the pilot has downloaded for their
 * operating area — see [UasfmStore] for the fetch and [UasfmIndex] for the lookup.
 *
 * **Why a separate database from [TerrainDatabase] rather than two more tables in it:** that DB
 * is built with `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()`, so bumping its schema version would silently
 * wipe the pilot's imported DTED regions. UASFM data is independent of terrain data, has its own
 * lifecycle (re-downloaded when the FAA updates, not imported once), and nothing joins across
 * the two — so there's no reason to put the DTED tiles at risk to store it.
 *
 * **Why no multi-region management (unlike DTED):** cells live in a single global grid keyspace
 * ([UasfmIndex]'s 1/120° row/col), so overlapping downloads would merge into the same rows and
 * there'd be no honest way to say which download "owns" a cell when the pilot deletes one. A
 * refcount scheme like the DTED junction table would work, but the coverage question here is
 * simpler than for terrain: the pilot wants ceilings for the area they're flying, and asking for
 * a bigger area is one download away. So this is deliberately a single dataset, replaced wholesale
 * on each download, with one [UasfmMetaEntity] row describing what's currently loaded.

/**
 * **Version 2 (2026-07-26): bumped deliberately to WIPE existing data, not because the schema
 * changed.** v1 was populated from the stale `FAA_UAS_FacilityMap_Data_V5` layer and contained
 * ceilings up to four years out of date — it reported 0 ft in a real 200 ft grid. With
 * `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` this bump drops those rows, so the app falls back to
 * showing "no FAA data downloaded" and the pilot re-downloads from the corrected source.
 *
 * Wiping is the right call over migrating: there is no way to correct the old rows in place,
 * and an airspace advisory silently serving wrong ceilings is worse than one that admits it has
 * nothing. Bump this again if the source layer ever changes.
