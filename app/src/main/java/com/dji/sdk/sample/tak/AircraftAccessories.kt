/**
 * THE TWO PAYLOAD ACCESSORIES on the Matrice 4TD: the AL1 LIGHT and the AS1 SPEAKER.
 *
 * The aircraft's own exterior lights are a different thing and live in [AircraftLights]. This
 * object is only for what is bolted on.
 *
 * ⚠ THE TWO ACCESSORIES REACH THE SDK BY TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ROUTES. This was MEASURED on
 * the bench on 2026-08-23, after two wrong guesses; the aircraft's own enumeration reads:
 *
 * ```
 * payload port UP:       connected=true name='Speaker'     type=DJI_SELF_RESEARCH_PSDK
 * payload port EXTERNAL: connected=true name='Searchlight' type=DJI_SELF_RESEARCH_PSDK
 * ```
 *
 * | Accessory | Route | Why |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | AS1 speaker | `MegaphoneManager` at index `UPSIDE` | A real manager, and the M4D capability file declares it |
 * | AL1 light | PSDK **WIDGETS** on port `EXTERNAL` | Every light KEY is refused on this airframe |
 *
 * ⚠ THE LIGHT IS NOT DRIVEN BY THE LIGHT KEYS. `SpotLightKey` and `PayloadKey.KeyLightCtrl` both
 * looked like the answer and both are wrong here. `KeyLightCtrl` returned `refused: null` on
 * every write. What the aircraft actually offers is three PSDK widgets, and they are the whole
 * control surface of the AL1:
 *
 * ```
 * widget @EXTERNAL: type=SWITCH name='on/off'      idx=0
 * widget @EXTERNAL: type=RANGE  name='brightiness' idx=1     (DJI's spelling, not ours)
 * widget @EXTERNAL: type=SWITCH name='blink'       idx=2
 * ```
 *
 * ⚠ AND "IT ANSWERED" IS NOT "IT IS THERE". Before the enumeration existed, this file walked the
 * light keys across ports and the SPEAKER's port answered `KeyLightState` with a complete,
 * plausible reply — `mode=CLOSE type=FLOOD brightness=10`. It latched that port, drew a light
 * control for a port with no light in it, and every write then failed. A payload is now found by
 * WHAT THE AIRCRAFT NAMES IT, never by which key happens to reply.
 *
 * ⚠ EVERY FIELD HERE IS THE AIRCRAFT'S ANSWER, NEVER OUR REQUEST (safety rule 4). The widget
 * values arrive by a PUSH listener, so the light's state is whatever the payload last reported.
 *
 * ⚠ LISTENERS ARE ATTACHED ONCE, in [start] (safety rule 1: a listener slot holds one client and
 * a second registration replaces the first with no warning). [reset] is the only way to detach.
 *
 * ⚠ These are WRITES TO A PAYLOAD, thus on an explicit pilot action only, never on a timer
 * (safety rule 3).

     * ⚠ THERE IS NO SETTLE TIME, AND THERE MUST NOT BE ONE. This used to wait a fixed 800ms and
     * then sample the widget cache. On the bench 2026-08-23 the payload's answer arrived 19ms
     * after that sample:
     *
     * ```
     * 21:34:08.419  light on/off: read-back = 0 (asked 1)      <- sampled here
     * 21:34:08.438  light widgets changed: on=1 bright=53      <- the truth, 19ms later
     * ```
     *
     * The light was on. The panel said it had refused, painted the pill off and left it there.
     * A timer cannot know when a payload has answered; the PUSH LISTENER knows, because the
