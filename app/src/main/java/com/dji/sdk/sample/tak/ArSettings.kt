 * **Three categories, not two.** The obvious split is "mine vs theirs", but the distinction that
 * actually matters in a busy picture is between other operators' POSITIONS and the markers those
 * operators have PLACED: a dozen people's position dots are what carpets the video, while their
 * placed markers are usually the thing worth seeing. Collapsing those two into one toggle would
 * force the pilot to lose both together. The split is free because
 * [TakMapMarkers.milMarkerRes] already classifies them.
 *
 * **Not the same thing as the per-uid local hide.** [TakMapMarkers.isHidden] dismisses one
 * specific marker everywhere, including the mini-map. These flags are AR-only and by category.
 * Both apply — a marker draws only if it passes both.
