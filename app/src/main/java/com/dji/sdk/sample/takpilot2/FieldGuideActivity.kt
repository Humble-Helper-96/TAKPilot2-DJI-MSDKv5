/**
 * Pilot field guide — a read-in-the-field explanation of what every control does.
 *
 * **Audience is the pilot, not a developer.** No class names, no file paths, no SDK talk. Where
 * a limitation matters to a flight decision it IS stated plainly (what the FAA layer can't tell
 * you, when the altitude readout is approximate, what a local marker delete does and doesn't
 * do), because a guide that only lists happy paths is the kind that gets someone in trouble.
 *
 * **Every pilot-facing string in this file is written in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical
 * English. Keep it that way when you edit.** STE is the aerospace controlled-language standard
 * (approved dictionary + 53 writing rules); it exists so that a reader who is tired, rushed, or
 * reading in a second language cannot mis-parse a safety-relevant instruction. The rules this
 * text is held to:
 *  - **One word, one meaning, one part of speech.** A short screen press is always "touch",
 *    never tap/press/hit. A long press is always "touch and hold". The airframe is always the
 *    "aircraft", never the drone. A marker is always a "marker", never a pin.
 *  - **Approved vocabulary.** "make sure" not ensure, "about" not approximately, "use" not
 *    utilize, "let" not allow, "get" not obtain, "but" not however, "because of" not due to.
 *  - **Active voice, simple tenses, no -ing forms.** "The app sends the marker", not "the
 *    marker is sent" or "sending the marker".
 *  - **Sentence length**: 20 words max for an instruction, 25 for description. Six sentences
 *    max per paragraph, one topic each.
 *  - **Conditions come first**: "If the signal is weak, select Low" — never the reverse.
 *  - **No idiom, metaphor, or humour.** They are the first thing to fail a tired reader and the
 *    first thing to fail a translator.
 *  - **Warnings open with the command**, then the reason.
 *
 * The one deliberate exception: **on-screen control labels are quoted verbatim** even when they
 * are not STE ("Drop Marker at Crosshair", "Enroll & Connect"). STE treats these as technical
 * names, and a guide that renames the button a pilot is hunting for is worse than useless.
 *
 * **The icon examples are live views, not pictures.** Each one is the real toolbar widget —
 * [BatteryGaugeView], [SignalBarsView], [LiveToggleView], [RecordToggleView], the TAK badge with
 * its status dot — constructed here and driven into the state being described. Screenshots or
 * hand-drawn copies would silently go stale the next time an icon changes; these can't, because
 * they ARE the icons. It also means a state shown here is genuinely reachable in the app.
 *
 * ## The 2026-08-18 cut, following the Autel sibling
 *
 * The guide was cut by roughly half, applying the rule the operator set on the sibling
 * (2026-08-15): **keep every fact that changes a flight decision, delete the explanation of
 * why.** A pilot needs "land when the ring is yellow", not a paragraph on how the gauge is
 * computed. A guide long enough that a pilot does not read it is worse than a short one that
 * omits something.
 *
 * What survived the cut and must not be trimmed again, because each one changes what a pilot
 * does: the battery-refusal warning (this airframe holds its own levels), the crosshair angle
 * and error table, the marker refusal conditions, what a marker delete does NOT do, and the
 * FAA "not an approval" warning.
 *
 * ## Two sections the Autel sibling has and this build does not
 *
 * Both are absent because the FUNCTION is absent, not because the guide is behind:
 *  - **The controller buttons.** Nothing on the RC Plus is wired in this app — there is no
 *    hardware-button listener on the flight screen. Write that section when there is.
 *  - **The aim calibration.** There are no Aim Offsets in this build. Section 5 says so.
 *
 * The in-flight channel picker (touch and hold on the TAK badge) is documented in BOTH places
 * it can be reached from — section 2 with the rest of the channel rules, and on the TAK
 * connection entry in section 3, where a pilot looking at the badge will find it.
 *
 * ## NO AIRFRAME IS NAMED IN THIS FILE, and it must stay that way
 *
 * The MSDKv4 sibling names the Mini 2 throughout, because that is the aircraft it flies.
 * **This SDK does not support the Mini 2 at all**, so every one of those sentences would be
 * false here — and two of them were dangerous rather than merely stale, which is why the
 * 2026-08-14 pass (conformance V15) removed them. When this text is next taken from the
 * sibling, take the facts and drop the airframe. The same rule applies to "phone": this build
 * runs on a smart controller.
