/**
 * Is the configured media server there, before the pilot presses LIVE?
 *
 * ⚠ **IT ANSWERS "REACHABLE", NOT "WILL ACCEPT MY STREAM", AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT A DETAIL.**
 * The operator asked for both. Only the first is knowable without publishing: whether the server
 * accepts THIS publisher depends on credentials, on whether the path is allowed to be published
 * to, and on whether it likes the codec — and every one of those is answered by the server
 * during a real publish handshake and not before. A probe that claimed otherwise would be the
 * same lie as a camera reporting OK for a lens it never changed.
 *
 * So: green here means "the server is up and speaking RTSP". **The LIVE pill remains the only
 * authority on whether the stream is actually being taken** — that is what its red and its amber
 * SYNC already say, from the real connection rather than from a guess.
 *
 * ## Why it probes RTSP even when the pilot has chosen SRT
 *
 * SRT is UDP. There is no connect to attempt and no reply to wait for; a probe would have to
 * perform a real SRT handshake, which needs the streaming library and is not a cheap check.
 *
 * But the media server always serves RTSP regardless — no TAK client plays SRT, so the address
 * advertised in the CoT is an RTSP address in both modes (see [VideoTransport]). Probing the
 * RTSP port therefore tests THE SERVER, which is what the pilot wants to know, and it works
 * identically for both transports. It does not test the SRT ingest port, and this is written
 * here so nobody later reads the green light as meaning more than it does.
 *
 * ## Why OPTIONS and not just a TCP connect
 *
 * A bare connect proves only that something accepted a socket — a load balancer, a captive
 * portal, a wrong host that happens to listen. `OPTIONS` makes it prove it speaks RTSP by
 * answering with an RTSP status line. One round trip, no session created, nothing to tear down.
