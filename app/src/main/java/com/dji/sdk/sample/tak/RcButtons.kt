/**
 * The RC Plus 2's Path B buttons — C1, C2, C3 — which reach the application only as MSDK keys
 * and never as Android input (`DJI-RC-Plus-2-Hardware.md` §6.5; verified silent in `getevent`
 * again on 2026-10-07 with a live capture bracketed by L1 and R1).
 *
 * ONE OWNER (safety rule 1): a listener slot holds one client and a second registration
 * silently replaces the first, so the keys are listened here and nowhere else, and the flight
 * screen is FED through [onC1]. Armed by the flight screen while it is up, disarmed when it
 * goes — the holder is this object, so a stale activity cannot keep the listen alive.
 *
 * Today only C1 has a consumer: the IR toggle, beside L3 (parity plan step 4). The others are
 * listened and logged so the bench shows they reach the application; a function waits for a
 * decision, not for plumbing. The keys are `DJIRemoteControllerKey`'s, not
 * `RemoteControllerKey`'s — checked against the 5.18 jar with javap, 2026-10-07.

     * The MSDK key is how DJI Pilot 2 takes the still; the firmware does nothing on its own
     * with another app in front (bench, 2026-10-07: no still in PHOTO mode). Whether the
     * half-press fires this key too is what the first bench press tells the log.
