/**
 * The outbound video quality tier the pilot picks (LIVE pill, touch and hold).
 *
 * R47: this used to be `StreamTranscoder.TranscodeProfile`, nested inside a 348-line class that
 * was never constructed. That class was v4's decode -> scale -> encode pipeline; v5 captures the
 * composited screen instead ([ScreenCaptureEncoder]), so the only living part of the file was
 * this enum. The class is gone — with it the latent defect R47 describes, where the encoder was
 * built on the first INFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT_CHANGED and a mid-stream resolution change (thermal 5:4
 * to visible 16:9) left stale dimensions and silently wrong geometry. It is in git if the
 * decode-transcode path is ever wanted back, and it must be fixed before it is.
 *
 * Renamed while moving: nothing transcodes any more, so "Transcode" described a pipeline that no
 * longer exists. The CONSTANT names are unchanged because [prefValue] derives from them, and a
 * saved preference has to keep resolving.
