/**
 * The obstacle-sensing cameras, rendered — DJI Pilot 2's small grey corner view.
 *
 * Deliberately a near-copy of [FpvTextureView] rather than a shared base class: this is a PROBE
 * (2026-08-24, v1.2.0 work) and it must not be able to break the main video feed, which is the
 * one thing on the flight screen a pilot cannot fly without. If the feature proves out, the two
 * merge; if it does not, this file is deleted and the FPV view was never touched.
 *
 * The only real difference is the component index: the same `putCameraStreamSurface` call the
 * main feed uses, pointed at [ComponentIndexType.VISION_ASSIST].
 *
 * ⚠ IT CANNOT TURN ITSELF ON. Rendering a surface is not enough — the AIRCRAFT has to be told to
 * produce the stream, which is [VisionAssist.setEnabled]. A blank view here with vision assist
 * off is expected, not a fault.
