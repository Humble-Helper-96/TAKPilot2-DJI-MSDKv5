/**
 * THE THREE STANDARDISED MESSAGES the aircraft can broadcast, held by this application.
 *
 * ⚠ THE APPLICATION OWNS THE LIBRARY, THE SPEAKER OWNS ONE SLOT. The AS1 holds exactly one
 * sound. Its name is hard-coded inside MSDK as `megaphone_file`, and `startPlay()` re-selects
 * that name on every play, so there is nothing on the aircraft to choose between. Measured
 * 2026-08-23: `SpeakerKey.KeyAudioFileList` is refused at all ten component indexes. A "list of
 * messages" therefore has to live HERE, and playing one means uploading it — see
 * [SpeakerBroadcast].
 *
 * ⚠ THE AUDIO FORMAT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE and it is why messages are RECORDED on the controller
 * rather than shipped with the application. The speaker takes RAW OPUS PACKETS — 16 kHz, mono,
 * 16 kbps CBR, 40 ms frames, concatenated with no Ogg container, no `OpusHead`, no length
 * prefixes. An `.opus` or `.ogg` file from ffmpeg is Ogg-encapsulated 48 kHz VBR and will not
 * play. The only two producers of the right bytes are DJI's own `OpusEncoder` (which
 * [SpeakerRecorder] drives, and which DJI's `MegaphoneVM` sample tees straight to a file exactly
 * this way) and `PCMTools`, whose output DJI's own documentation deprecates at MSDK 5.14.0 and
 * whose `convertToOpusFileSync` mis-frames the tail of any PCM that is not a multiple of 2560
 * bytes. So: the recorder is the source of truth.
 *
 * At 16 kbps the arithmetic is simple and worth keeping in one place: **2 KB per second of
 * audio**, 80 bytes per 40 ms packet. A ten-second message is about 20 KB.
