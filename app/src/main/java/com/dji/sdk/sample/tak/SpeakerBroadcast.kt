/**
 * SENDS ONE STANDARDISED MESSAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT AND PLAYS IT.
 *
 * The speaker holds one sound, so every play is an upload. [SpeakerMessages] explains why there
 * is no library on the aircraft to pick from.
 *
 * ⚠ **`onSuccess` FIRES ONCE PER 8 KB CHUNK, AND A NORMAL FIRST-WINS LATCH WOULD TRUNCATE EVERY
 * MESSAGE.** This is the trap in this whole feature and it is read from the 5.18 bytecode, not
 * guessed: `MegaphoneManager$FileReadRunnable` is constructed with THE SAME
 * `CompletionCallbackWithProgress` the caller passed, and its per-chunk `addUploadBuffer`
 * acknowledgement calls `CallbackUtils.onSuccess` on it. So does `finishUpload`. So does the
 * upload listener's `SUCCESS_UPLOAD`. A `compareAndSet(false, true)` guard of the kind safety
 * rule 9 asks for would therefore fire on the acknowledgement of the FIRST 8 KB — and a 20 KB
 * "EVACUATE" would broadcast about 40% of itself, over a public area, and report success.
 *
 * ⚠ **AND THE PROGRESS PERCENTAGE NEVER REACHES 100.** The first rule written here was
 * "progress 100 AND THEN an onSuccess", and it failed on the bench 2026-08-24: an 11360B message
 * uploaded cleanly in 644ms and the highest progress MSDK ever reported was NINETY-NINE, because
 * it computes `100 * alreadySentBytes / totalBytes` in integer arithmetic. The genuine completion
 * arrived at 99%, was discarded as a chunk ack, and a message the aircraft was holding got
 * reported to the pilot as refused.
 *
 * So NEITHER callback decides completion now. The upload is finished when the progress STOPS
 * ADVANCING ([PROGRESS_SETTLE_MS]), and then the AIRCRAFT is asked whether it is ready —
 * `MegaphoneStatus.IN_TRANSMISSION` means it is still receiving, and `startPlay` independently
 * refuses with `MEGAPHONE_HAS_STARTED` unless the speaker is IDLE. That refusal is the real guard
 * against broadcasting a fragment, and it is the aircraft's answer instead of our inference
 * (safety rule 10). Both of the callback-shape rules that came before this were wrong; the
 * aircraft's own state was right the first time.
 *
 * ⚠ TTS IS NOT AN OPTION ON THIS AIRFRAME and nothing here should reach for it.
 * `MegaphoneManager.startUpload()` refuses `UploadType.TTS_DATA` with `FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED`
 * locally, before any radio traffic, when the product is the M4D series — which this is. The
 * payload's own `tts=true` does not override the client-side gate.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS OBJECT REGISTERS NO SDK LISTENER (safety rule 1). It calls `MegaphoneManager` verbs and
 * reads state through [AircraftAccessories].
