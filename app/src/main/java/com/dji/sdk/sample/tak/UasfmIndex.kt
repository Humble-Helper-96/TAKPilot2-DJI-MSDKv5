/**
 * In-memory lookup of FAA UASFM altitude ceilings for whatever [UasfmStore] has downloaded.
 * Rebuilt lazily on first use; [UasfmStore] calls [invalidate] after a download or clear.
 *
 * **The grid, and why there's no polygon math here.** Every UASFM cell in the FAA's published
 * data is an axis-aligned rectangle on a fixed 30 arc-second (1/120°) grid — verified against
 * real cells around Ted Stevens Anchorage Intl, whose corners land exactly on 1/120° boundaries
 * (e.g. 61.1333345… → 61.1416679…, exactly one grid step). So a point's cell is pure integer
 * arithmetic: `floor(lat * 120)`, `floor(lon * 120)`. No geometry is stored and no
 * point-in-polygon test is needed, which is what keeps a statewide dataset small enough to sit
 * in a HashMap and be queried on the flight screen's tick.
 *
 * Row/col are derived from each feature's LATITUDE/LONGITUDE fields — the cell *center* — rather
 * than its polygon corners: the published corners carry ~1e-6° of floating-point noise, so a
 * corner can land a hair on the wrong side of a boundary, while a center is a half-cell away
 * from the nearest one and can't.
 *
 * If the FAA ever ships cells off this grid, [UasfmStore]'s download logs a warning per
 * off-grid feature rather than silently mis-binning them.
