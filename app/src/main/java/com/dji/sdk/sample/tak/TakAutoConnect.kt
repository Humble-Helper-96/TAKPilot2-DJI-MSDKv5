/**
 * Silent TAK reconnect from saved enrollment — no UI, no password re-entry. Used three ways:
 *  - [attemptOnAppLaunch]: fired once per PROCESS from the home screen's onCreate, so a
 *    configured server is connected, with channels pulled, before the pilot even opens
 *    Pre-Flight Setup.
 *  - [retryIfDown]: fired whenever the home screen or Pre-Flight is SHOWN. This is the one
 *    that actually covers a pilot — read its note for why once-per-process is not enough.
 *  - [toggle]: the flight-screen TAK icon's on/off tap (connect if saved creds exist and we're
 *    not connected; disconnect otherwise).
 *
 * Shares the same SharedPreferences keys as [TakConnectActivity].

     * (2026-10-09).** [attemptOnAppLaunch] fires once, from the home screen's `onCreate`, and
     * the home screen is `singleTask` — so coming back to it does not run again, and
     * `attemptedThisProcess` would block it anyway. The retry that actually covered the pilot
     * was the one in Pre-Flight's own `onCreate`, and that went to [TakServerActivity] with
     * the rest of the TAK configuration. The result was an app that would not reconnect unless
     * the pilot opened a screen they have no other reason to open, or tapped the flight
     * screen's TAK icon.
     *
     * ⚠ A LIVE PROCESS IS THE CASE THAT MATTERS. The foreground service keeps this process
     * alive across a swipe-away, so "launching the app again" is often not a new process at
     * all: `attemptedThisProcess` is still true and nothing retries. Tie the retry to a SCREEN
     * BEING SHOWN, not to a process starting.
     *
     * Safe to call as often as you like: [reconnect] refuses when an attempt is already in
     * flight, so this cannot spawn parallel connects.
