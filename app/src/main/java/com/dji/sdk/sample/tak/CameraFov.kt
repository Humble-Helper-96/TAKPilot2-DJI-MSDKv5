/**
 * The camera's OWN field of view, from its reported focal length — the calibration knob's
 * replacement, and the first correct FOV above 1x.
 *
 * MEASURED ON THE BENCH, 2026-08-20, stepping the ladder with the probe build (vc61):
 *
 *   KeyCameraHybridZoomFocalLength  700 / 1680 / 3360 / 6720 at rungs 3/7/14/28
 *   KeyCameraOpticalZoomFocalLength 240 while the WIDE camera is live
 *   KeyThermalFocalLength 52, KeyCameraIRFocalLength 527, constant
 *
 * The unit is the 35mm-EQUIVALENT focal length (x10 on hybrid/optical/ir; x1 on thermal), and
 * the hybrid value is LIVE — it includes the current zoom. Note 700 at "3X": the camera's real
 * gear is 2.917x, which dividing a base FOV by the nominal rung could never know. The
 * equivalence convention is full-frame DIAGONAL (43.27mm), confirmed against DJI's own spec:
 * 24mm equiv -> 84 deg diagonal, the published wide FOV; 52.7mm -> ~45 deg, the published
 * thermal FOV.
 *
 * So:  dfov = 2*atan(43.27 / (2*f35))   and the horizontal follows from the live picture
 * shape ([TakBridgeHolder.setVideoAspect]), the same identity the one-knob calibration uses.
 *
 * `KeyRetrieveLensFOV` — the key that SHOULD answer this directly — is refused for every lens
 * on this airframe (measured, 14 refusals per lens). The focal-length route is the one the
 * aircraft actually serves.
 *
 * ⚠ ASYNC READS ONLY (safety rule 4): the one-argument getValue reads a cache that is empty
 * on a cold start. And the answer is fed through a sanity gate — a camera that reports
 * something absurd must not send every marker to infinity.
