/**
 * Draws inbound TAK CoT contacts/markers on the flight mini-map. Third port of TAKPilot2's
 * TakMapMarkers (DJI uxsdk mapkit -> osmdroid -> MapLibre); the Autel/osmdroid version is the
 * direct reference.
 *
 * The structural difference from both references: osmdroid and mapkit hand out one `Marker`
 * object per contact, pushed into an overlay list. MapLibre has no such thing — everything on
 * screen is one [GeoJsonSource] holding a [FeatureCollection] plus one [SymbolLayer], with the
 * per-contact bitmaps registered into the style as named images ([Style.addImage]) that each
 * Feature references by name. So [shown] is the model, and [rebuild] re-serializes the whole
 * collection whenever anything changes. That's cheap at TAK-picture scale (tens of contacts)
 * and avoids any incremental-diff bookkeeping.
 *
 * Icon generation, the `iconKeyFor` cache scheme, 2525 type parsing, and persistence of
 * received markers are ports of the Autel logic and behave identically.

     * 29% of a 180dp map's height. This map is SMALLER still at 130dp compact, so the old sizes
     * were worse here than they were there — a 32dp marker was a quarter of the map's width.
     * The expanded 260dp state makes the new sizes roomier again rather than tighter.
