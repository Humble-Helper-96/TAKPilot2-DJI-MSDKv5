/**
 * What the flight screen's banner shows, and when.
 *
 * ## Why this is an arbitration layer, not a second warning source
 *
 * This aircraft already has a real one. `DJIDiagnostics` is a first-class SDK channel that
 * reports compass, IMU, battery and no-fly-zone faults in DJI's own localised words, and
 * [DjiSdkBridge] already subscribes to it and de-duplicates it. The Autel sibling had to
 * hand-derive all of that from status booleans **because it has no such channel**. Rebuilding
 * the reconstruction here and letting it compete with the real thing would be a regression, and
 * would show the same fault twice in two different wordings.
 *
 * So the aircraft's own faults arrive through [onDiagnostics] and are shown VERBATIM at the top
 * of the priority order. This object never re-words them and never decides one is not worth
 * seeing. What it adds is the tier that `DJIDiagnostics` has no equivalent for — the aircraft
 * flying itself home, its own battery thresholds, the configured altitude and distance limits, a
 * missing home point, wind — plus the display discipline the raw banner lacked.
 *
 * ## What the display discipline is for
 *
 * Before this, `renderDiagnostics` did `items.joinToString("\n")`: every active fault, unbounded,
 * with no hold. A fault that flaps at the callback rate strobes, and a long list grows down over
 * the video. Here one warning owns the banner at a time — the worst — held for [HOLD_MS] so a
 * flicker cannot make the text jump, with a `+N` count for the rest. A worse warning preempts
 * immediately; nothing is ever hidden, only queued.
 *
 * ## No-fly zone stays on the banner (operator, 2026-08-11)
 *
 * The Autel sibling made its NO-FLY ZONE warning log-only, because that fleet flies under an FAA
 * exception and a red banner routinely correct to ignore teaches pilots to ignore red. **That
 * decision is not carried here.** This tree has its own field lesson pointing the other way:
 * "Cannot takeoff in a no-fly zone" was invisible through two flights, and `renderDiagnostics`
 * was written specifically not to filter by severity because of it. DJI's no-fly-zone diagnostic
 * therefore flows through [onDiagnostics] like any other aircraft fault and is displayed.
 *
 * ## Fed, never subscribed
 *
 * Same contract as [FlightPathLogger]. [onState] is called from the `FlightControllerState`
 * callback [DroneTakBridge] already owns; the SDK slot holds one client. Nothing here touches
 * the SDK.
