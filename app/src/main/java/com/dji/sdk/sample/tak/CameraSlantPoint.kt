     * back to [FALLBACK_RANGE_M] so a point still shows. Then project that HORIZONTAL
     * distance from the aircraft along the camera bearing.
     *
     * When [elevationAt] is supplied (typically [DtedIndex]::elevationAt) and returns
     * coverage for the aircraft's own position, this refines the flat-ground estimate by
     * fixed-point iteration: [aglMeters] is DJI's altitude-above-takeoff-point, which the
     * flat-ground path already treats as "height above the ground directly below the
     * aircraft." Each iteration samples DTED elevation at the current candidate ground
     * point, adjusts the effective height-above-target by the elevation delta between the
     * aircraft's local ground and the target's ground, and recomputes — typically converges
     * in 2-3 iterations over smooth terrain. Falls back to the flat-ground point if there's
     * no DTED coverage at the aircraft's own position, or if a later iteration's candidate
     * point walks outside the loaded tiles' coverage.
     *
     * Known limitation: DTED elevations are referenced to a geoid/MSL vertical datum, while
     * [aglMeters] comes from DJI's WGS84-ellipsoid-based GPS altitude — the two can differ by
     * tens of meters depending on location (geoid separation), which isn't corrected for
     * here. This still meaningfully improves on the flat-ground assumption over hilly terrain
     * (the dominant error source), but don't expect survey-grade accuracy.
