/**
 * TAKPilot2 Go flight screen — live FPV video (full-bleed) + a live map overlay, phone-sized.
 * Owns the [TakBridgeHolder] telemetry-to-CoT bridge's lifecycle (Phase 4): starts it on
 * entry, stops it on exit. TakManager.sendDronePLI() no-ops internally when TAK isn't
 * connected, so this runs safely whether or not TAK Setup has been done yet.
 *
 * Also drives the on-screen telemetry HUD + own-aircraft map marker (Phase 4 addendum) — a
 * 500ms poll of [TakBridgeHolder.hud], same pattern as the Autel sibling app's FlightActivity.
 * Inbound TAK contacts/markers are drawn by [com.dji.sdk.sample.tak.TakMapMarkers], which owns
 * its own source/layer on this screen's style (Phase 6A); dropped pins and the AR overlay
 * (6B–6D) are still to come.

     * THE CONTROLLER'S L BUTTONS (operator, 2026-08-20, second revision same day):
     *
     *   L1 tap  — the quick (dynamic) marker: same function as touching the crosshair.
     *   L1 hold — a static Unknown marker: same function as holding the crosshair.
     *   L2      — the accessory panel: the AL1 light and the AS1 speaker (2026-08-23).
     *   L3      — thermal on/off: same function as the IR pill.
     *
     * One button for both marker kinds, the same tap/hold split the crosshair itself has —
     * so L1 IS the crosshair, in button form. Each route ends in the SAME function as its
     * on-screen control (the sibling's doctrine); the hint chips on the screen's left edge
     * say what the buttons do, DJI Pilot 2's own idiom for these slots.
     *
     * ⚠ L2 IS THE ONE EXCEPTION TO THAT DOCTRINE: the accessory panel has no on-screen control,
     * so L2 is the only way to it. That was the operator's call (2026-08-23) — the action bar has
     * overflowed its width before and a fourth pill was not worth the room. The consequence is
     * that the ◀ ACC chip is not a reminder here, it is the ONLY sign the panel exists, so it
     * must never be hidden, and the function is in the Field Guide for the same reason.
     *
     * The tap/hold split uses the framework's own tracking: startTracking() on the down,
     * onKeyLongPress for the hold, and the up only fires the tap when the long press has not
     * (isCanceled). No hand-rolled timers.
