/**
 * Obstacle-avoidance state, cached process-wide. The DJI counterpart of the Autel port's
 * `AutelAvoidance`, deliberately the same shape so the ports stay readable side by side.
 *
 * v5 port notes:
 * - v4's per-face VisionDetectionState callbacks are gone. v5's PerceptionManager pushes ONE
 *   [ObstacleData] with a horizontal distance ring (List<Int>, one entry per
 *   `horizontalAngleInterval` degrees) plus single up/down distances.
 * - **Units are MILLIMETRES.** The uxsdk RadarWidgetModel divides these by 1000 to get
 *   metres; this file does the same in exactly one place ([mmToMeters]).
 * - The horizontal ring is folded into four [Face] quadrants so the edge view keeps its v4
 *   shape. Ring index 0 is assumed to be the aircraft NOSE, increasing clockwise —
 *   ⚠ VERIFY ON THE BENCH with a wall on a known side before trusting left/right.
 * - v4's three avoidance switches do NOT collapse to one in v5. [ObstacleAvoidanceType]
 *   (BRAKE/BYPASS/CLOSE) is the coarse one, and there are others.
 *
 *   ⚠ **THIS FILE USED TO SAY "RTH avoidance and landing protection are aircraft-firmware
 *   behavior in v5 with no public switch" AND THAT WAS FALSE.** It was written from the one
 *   API somebody found, not from the SDK surface, and it cost a flight: the Pre-Flight
 *   landing box was wired to nothing, the status line said "not read yet" for ever, and the
 *   aircraft descended with whatever the last app left behind. Disassembled from
 *   `dji-sdk-v5-aircraft-provided-5.18.0.jar` on 2026-10-09, `IVisualManager` and
 *   `IPerceptionCommon` carry, each with a getter:
 *
 *     setObstacleAvoidanceEnabled(bool, PerceptionDirection)   // UPWARD/DOWNWARD/HORIZONTAL
 *     setVisionPositioningEnabled(bool)
 *     setPrecisionLandingEnabled(bool)
 *     setOverallObstacleAvoidanceEnabled(bool)
 *     setObstacleAvoidanceBrakingDistance(double, PerceptionDirection)
 *     setObstacleAvoidanceWarningDistance(double, PerceptionDirection)
 *
 *   DJI Pilot 2's own takeoff record on this airframe reports exactly these as
 *   `downward_obstacle_avoidance=1`, `OA_distance=3.0`, `OA_warning_distance=10.69`.
 *
 *   ⚠ RTH avoidance genuinely has no public v5 switch — that half of the old claim stands.
 *   Its field stays null and its Pre-Flight control says so.
 *
 * - **A CUSHIONED LANDING IS THREE SETTINGS, NOT ONE.** Downward avoidance sees the ground,
 *   vision positioning is what holds the aircraft steady over it, and precision landing is
 *   the auto-land behaviour. Any one of them off takes the cushion away, which is why they
 *   are read and enforced together rather than behind a single boolean.
 *
 * Absence must not read as safety: a ring that never reports means "this aircraft cannot
 * see that way", NOT "that way is clear" — [sensingAircraft] stays false until real data
 * arrives, and the display stays hidden.

     * RETREAT. It enforced a Pre-Flight selection by writing [ObstacleAvoidanceType], and on
     * this airframe every part of that was broken:
     *
     *  - **The M4TD REJECTS the getter.** `getObstacleAvoidanceType` answers
     *    "unavailable: null" on this aircraft (bench, 2026-10-09), so the value it was
     *    guarding on could never be known. That field is gone with the write.
     *  - **Which made the write BLIND.** The guard was `if (<the unread value> == desired)`,
     *    and null never equals true — so the "only correct what is wrong" rule degraded into
     *    writing a flight-safety setting the app had just failed to read. Rule 4.
     *  - **And the chain died silently.** The flight-state gate resolves fail-safe only when a
     *    callback FIRES with a failure; a key that never answers at all leaves it hanging, with
     *    no write, no skip and no log line. Observed on the same bench. "An observer nobody
     *    subscribes to is not a mechanism" — this tree has written that down before.
     *
     * **THE REASON IT IS SAFE TO STOP IS NOT THAT THE WRITES WERE BROKEN — IT IS THAT THIS
     * AIRCRAFT HAS A PROPER CONFIGURATION SURFACE ALREADY.** These settings live in the
     * AIRCRAFT, not in an app; DJI Pilot 2 is on the same controller and sets them well, and
     * what it sets persists into this application. The MSDKv4 sibling has no avoidance code at
     * all and lands correctly, which is the same evidence from the other direction.
     *
     * ⚠ **THE AUTEL SIBLING STILL ENFORCES, AND MUST.** Its doctrine — "leaving whatever the
     * other app last set is not neutral, it is UNKNOWN" — is right FOR AUTEL, where there is
     * no second app to set it. Copying that here solved a problem this tree does not have.
     * This is a deliberate per-tree difference with a reason, not a gap to close.
     *
     * What survives, and what actually mattered in the Autel incident of 2026-08-13, is that
     * the pilot is shown the aircraft's REAL state — never a tick that does nothing.
