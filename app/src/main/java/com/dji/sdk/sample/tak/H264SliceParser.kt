/**
 * Minimal H.264 slice/SPS header parser — enough to answer ONE diagnostic question:
 * **are frames actually being lost in transit, or are they arriving intact-but-corrupt?**
 *
 * Built 2026-07-27 after two instrumented flights ruled out the two obvious explanations for
 * the FPV artifacting (signal was 100% throughout; our own NAL queue essentially never
 * overflowed). What those counters CANNOT see is small loss: NAL throughput sits at ~600 per
 * 5s window with ±3-4 of jitter purely from window alignment, so one or two lost slices is
 * arithmetically indistinguishable from normal variance. Meanwhile the stream runs ~4 NALs per
 * rendered frame, i.e. multi-slice pictures — and losing ONE slice corrupts one horizontal band
 * of the image, which is exactly the reported symptom (corruption appearing in the streets,
 * then rooftops, then grass, accumulating over a static scene).
 *
 * `frame_num` settles it. It is a counter in every slice header that increments once per
 * reference picture, so a jump of more than one is direct, unambiguous evidence that a picture
 * never arrived — regardless of what any RF-level signal metric claims. If frame_num is
 * perfectly sequential while artifacts still build, the frames ARE arriving and the corruption
 * is inside them (bit errors surviving DJI's transport), which is a completely different root
 * cause needing a completely different fix.
 *
 * **No longer diagnosis-only.** It started that way, but the numbers it produced turned out to
 * name a decode bug rather than an RF one (multi-slice pictures were being fed to MediaCodec one
 * slice at a time), so [parseFirstMbInSlice] is now on the decode path itself, driving
 * access-unit assembly in `FpvTextureView`. [parseSliceHeader] and [parseSpsLog2MaxFrameNum]
 * remain instrumentation.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately tiny — it parses the first few fields of a header and stops. It does not
 * decode anything, and it must never throw into the DJI callback thread it runs on, so every
 * entry point returns null on anything unexpected rather than propagating.
