/**
 * RECORDS A STANDARDISED MESSAGE on the controller, into the exact bytes the AS1 accepts.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS CLASS NEVER TOUCHES THE AIRCRAFT. Not one `MegaphoneManager` call, deliberately: a
 * message is recorded on the ground, on a bench, with no aircraft powered. Broadcasting is
 * [SpeakerBroadcast]'s job and it is a separate decision. Keeping the two apart is also what
 * makes the recorder testable without a Matrice.
 *
 * It is [SpeakerTalk] with ONE substitution: the encoded frames go to a file instead of to
 * `sendRealTimeDataToMegaphone`. That is not a coincidence — DJI's own `MegaphoneVM` sample tees
 * the same encoder output to a file and then uploads that file, so this pipeline IS the upload
 * format. There is no conversion step and nothing to get wrong about containers or sample rates:
 * `AudioRecordHandler` forces 16 kHz mono and `OpusEncoder` is configured from it.
 *
 * ⚠ THE MICROPHONE IS A PROCESS SINGLETON, and [SpeakerTalk] holds the other half of that
 * problem. The two REFUSE each other rather than tidying up after each other: this refuses to
 * start while `SpeakerTalk.talking`, and `SpeakerTalk` refuses to start while [recording]. A
 * "release whatever is there" call in either direction is how one feature silently steals the
 * microphone from the other mid-sentence.
 *
 * ⚠ PRESS TO START, PRESS TO STOP — NOT A HOLD, and that is not a contradiction of
 * [SpeakerTalk]'s hold-only doctrine. The doctrine exists because a toggle can leave the
 * AIRCRAFT emitting with nobody aware. Nothing here reaches the aircraft, and asking an operator
 * to hold a button steady for a twenty-five second message is a worse control, not a safer one.
