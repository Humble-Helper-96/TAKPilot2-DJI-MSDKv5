/**
 * Follows the camera's OWN zoom ratio, however it was commanded.
 *
 * ⚠ THE RIGHT DIAL IS WIRED TO THE CAMERA BY DJI'S FIRMWARE — the same path as the hardware
 * record button. Found on the bench 2026-08-20: with this app's own dial listener stepping the
 * ladder, the camera ALSO ramped continuously under the firmware's command, smoothly zoomed
 * itself to 1x with no app involvement, and left the zoom pill claiming 7X. This app cannot
 * disable that path (and must not — the controller stays OEM-intact by project rule), so an
 * app-side dial handler is a fight with the firmware that the firmware always wins.
 *
 * So the app FOLLOWS instead: this listener tracks KeyCameraZoomRatios and hands every change
 * to the flight screen, which updates the pill, clears any display crop, and re-reads the
 * camera-reported FOV. The pill can then never disagree with the picture, whoever moved it.
 *
 * Also measured: driven by the dial, the camera sits BETWEEN its gears (the clamping to
 * [1, 3, 7, 14, 28] applies to set-requests, not to native motion) and reports its true
 * hybrid focal length while it moves — so the FOV stays honest at any ratio the dial finds.
 *
 * This object owns the SDK listen (safety rule 1). The flight screen arms it in onResume and
 * disarms in onPause.
