/**
 * THE ONE PLACE THAT COMPOSES THE STREAM PATH.
 *
 * The path is the name the media server knows the feed by. It goes out in three places and
 * every one of them must agree, or the push lands under one name and the team is told another:
 *
 *  - the SRT stream id, `publish:<path>:<user>:<pass>` ([DroneVideoStreamer.VideoConfig.pushUrl]);
 *  - the RTSP push address, `rtsp://host:port/<path>` (the same function);
 *  - the CoT `__video` url and its `ConnectionEntry` path
 *    ([DroneVideoStreamer.VideoConfig.advertiseUrl], parsed by `CotBuilder.appendVideo`).
 *
 * [DroneVideoStreamer.VideoConfig.streamPath] is the only caller of [compose], and every address
 * is built from it. Do not build the path a second time anywhere else.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * ```
 *   <broadcast id>-Low                 randomize OFF — unchanged from every earlier version
 *   <broadcast id>-<token>-Low         randomize ON
 * ```
 *
 * The `-Low` suffix stays LAST: the media server's path rules and its transcode logic key on a
 * name that ends in `-Low`, and the agency rules key on the `<agency>-` prefix the pilot types at
 * the front of the broadcast id. The token goes between the two so that both survive.
 *
 * ⚠ **THE SUFFIX IS UNCONDITIONAL, AND THAT IS A PRODUCT RULE** (operator, 2026-10-07): a live
 * stream is always a reduced stream, so it is always `-Low`. Original quality belongs to the
 * aircraft's own recording to the SD card, which is a separate function and never goes through
 * this class. The suffix used to be conditional on an `isTranscode` flag that tested for the
 * v4-era `"original"` passthrough profile — a profile ledger R22 had already deleted, which no
 * current screen can write and which every start path normalises away. Two things came of
 * removing it. The pre-flight card read the pref RAW while the streamer normalised it, so a
 * legacy install was SHOWN a path with no `-Low` while it PUBLISHED one with it. And a token on
 * a suffixless path would have survived into the CoT video uid, because the strip in
 * `CotBuilder.videoUidKey` anchors on `-Low` — the team would have collected a new video alias
 * at every launch, which is the exact fault that strip exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## The token, and why it lives in memory only
 *
 * A fixed path is guessable. Anyone who can reach the server with any valid credential, or from
 * an address range the server trusts without one, can open a feed by typing its name. The token
 * makes the name unguessable, thus a feed can be watched only by a client that holds the CURRENT
 * CoT.
 *
 * ⚠ **One token per PROCESS.** [sessionToken] is created on first use from [SecureRandom] and
 * then held for the life of the process. It is never written to a preference or a file, so a
 * restart of the application always yields a new one. It does NOT change when the stream stops
 * and starts, when the SRT link drops and reconnects, when the aircraft lands and takes off, or
 * when an activity is recreated — none of those restart the process. A token that changed
 * mid-session would leave the team holding a CoT that names a feed which no longer exists.
 *
 * ⚠ The CoT video uid must NOT follow the token. `CotBuilder.videoUidFor` strips the token
 * segment before it hashes the url, so ATAK keeps one video alias per aircraft instead of one per
 * flight. That strip is shared core — the `taklite-core` master holds it — and it is pinned here
 * by [StreamPathTest] and there by `CotBuilderTest`.
