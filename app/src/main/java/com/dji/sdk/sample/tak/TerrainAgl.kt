/**
 * Turns DJI's takeoff-relative altitude into a true height above the ground *under the
 * aircraft*, using the pilot's imported DTED ([DtedIndex]).
 *
 * **The correction.** `FlightControllerState.aircraftLocation.altitude` is height above the
 * takeoff point, not above the terrain below. Over flat ground those agree; fly off a bluff or
 * up a valley and they diverge by exactly the terrain difference. So:
 *
 *     correctedAgl = takeoffRelativeAlt + (terrainElevAtTakeoff − terrainElevUnderAircraft)
 *
 * **Why a difference of two DTED samples, rather than absolute altitudes.** DTED is
 * MSL-referenced while GNSS altitude is WGS84-ellipsoid; that geoid offset is tens of metres in
 * places and is a known open item for this app's SPoI. Here it **cancels** — both samples come
 * from the same dataset in the same datum, so only their difference is used and the offset drops
 * out entirely. That's why this deliberately does NOT use
 * `FlightControllerState.getTakeoffLocationAltitude()`: mixing an SDK "altitude above sea level"
 * (whose datum and error we can't verify) with a DTED MSL sample would reintroduce exactly the
 * datum problem this formulation avoids.
 *
 * **The takeoff reference is latched, not re-read.** It's captured from the home location the
 * first time one is available, because at that moment home *is* the takeoff point — but the
 * pilot can move the home point mid-flight (long-press RTH resets it to the phone's position).
 * The aircraft's altitude stays referenced to where it actually took off, so the terrain
 * reference has to as well; re-reading it from a moved home point would silently corrupt the
 * correction by the terrain difference between the two.
 *
 * Reset per flight via [reset], called when a new [DroneTakBridge] session starts.
 *
 * **Residual error sources** (this is a correction, not truth): DTED's own vertical accuracy,
 * its post spacing smoothing over real terrain, and any difference between the true takeoff
 * elevation and DTED's value there — taking off from a rooftop, a vehicle, or a riverbank the
 * terrain model doesn't resolve all bias the reference. It is still substantially better than
 * no correction the moment the aircraft leaves the elevation it launched from.
