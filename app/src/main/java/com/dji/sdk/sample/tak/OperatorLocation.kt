/**
 * The CONTROLLER's own position — the pilot on the ground, not the aircraft.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The application published a position for the aircraft only. The operator marker was a single
 * registration message sent at connect with hardcoded `0, 0`, and nothing ever replaced it —
 * `TakManager.sendPLI`, the method that takes a real position, had no caller anywhere in the
 * source. So the team saw the pilot's callsign at latitude 0, longitude 0 until it went stale.
 *
 * ## Why `getLastKnownLocation` is not enough
 *
 * That method reads a CACHE. Nothing fills the cache unless some application on the device has
 * asked for position updates. On a controller where no other application does, it returns null
 * for ever, which is what made this look like a permission fault when it was not one.
 * **A real `requestLocationUpdates` is the only thing that fills it.**
 *
 * ## Behaviour
 *
 * Both providers are requested. GPS is accurate but needs a view of the sky and takes time to
 * fix; the network provider is coarse but answers immediately and indoors. The most recent fix
 * from either wins, because for a marker that says "the pilot is here" a coarse position now is
 * more use than an exact one in two minutes.
 *
 * If the permission is not granted this stays silent and [latest] stays null. The caller then
 * publishes no operator position at all, which is correct: no marker is better than a marker at
 * `0, 0`.

     * position is worse than publishing nothing, because the marker REFRESHES — every push
     * resets its stale time, so a wrong position never ages off the team's map the way a
     * silence would. Ten minutes keeps the seed's actual purpose (a message before the first
     * fix of THIS session) and rejects the depot-from-last-Tuesday case.
