/**
 * The configuration lock — one implementation, used by every screen that has one.
 *
 * It was a private pair of methods on [TakConnectActivity] until 2026-10-09, when the TAK
 * server configuration moved to [TakServerActivity] and a second screen needed the same lock.
 * Copying it would have been the obvious thing and the wrong one: the two rules below are
 * SAFETY rules that were each arrived at from a real fault, and a copy is how one screen keeps
 * them while the other quietly stops.
 *
 * ⚠ **RULE 1: LOCKED IS NOT HIDDEN.** A lock stops a CHANGE. It never stops a pilot READING the
 * state — the scope of this aircraft, where its video goes, what the aircraft was told. Any
 * treatment that makes the current value harder to read is wrong, however tidy it looks.
 *
 * ⚠ **RULE 2: A CONTROL WHOSE STATE IS ITS TICK MUST NOT BE DIMMED.** [apply] dims to 45 %,
 * which on a check box or a radio button greys the TICK as well as the label, and the tick is
 * the information. Such controls are kept OUT of the field list and are locked by dropping
 * their `isClickable`/`isFocusable` instead — see the `afterChange` hook, which exists for
 * exactly that. This was found twice: once on the channel rows, once on the video-server
 * toggle.
