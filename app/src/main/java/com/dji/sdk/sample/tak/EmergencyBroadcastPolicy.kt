/**
 * What the APPLICATION does when an Emergency Broadcast starts, renews or ends: one line in
 * the active flight's record — see [FlightPathLogger.event]. No "who" (operator, 2026-10-08);
 * that is recorded outside the application.
 *
 * Installed once at application start, so it runs whichever screen is open, or none — a
 * broadcast that expires while the pilot is on Pre-Flight Setup must still be recorded.
 * `TAKPilot2GoFlightActivity` only paints; it holds no policy.
 *
 * Nothing else happens at the end of a broadcast. The video link simply goes back to being
 * embedded on the Elevated connection only (`TakManager.videoFor`); the stream path is left
 * alone (operator, 2026-10-08 — a token rotation at the end was built and then removed as more
 * than the feature needs).
