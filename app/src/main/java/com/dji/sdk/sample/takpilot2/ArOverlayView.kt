/**
 * Augmented-reality overlay: projects TAK marker positions onto the live FPV so they appear
 * pinned to the world. Third port of TAKPilot2's ArOverlayView (V5 → V4), with three deliberate
 * departures from the reference — see below.
 *
 * **Sub-phase A: dropped pins only.** Inbound TAK contacts come in 6B of the phase plan. Pins
 * are first on purpose: a pin is placed at [TakBridgeHolder.lookPoint], which is derived from
 * the same camera pose this view projects with, so **a freshly dropped pin must render dead
 * centre under the crosshair.** That is a ground-truth test needing no second TAK client, no
 * survey point and no flying — if it doesn't land under the crosshair, the projection, the pose
 * or the video rect is wrong, and there's no point adding contacts on top of that.
 *
 * ### Departures from the V5 reference
 *
 * 1. **Perspective, not linear, projection.** V5 maps angle to pixels linearly
 *    (`x = cx + Δbearing / (hFov/2) · halfW`), which is a small-angle approximation. A real lens
 *    is gnomonic, so this uses `tan(Δ)/tan(fov/2)`. At the Mini 2's 73° horizontal FOV the
 *    difference is visible toward the frame edges — and it vanishes at the centre, which is what
 *    makes it easy to miss when eyeballing a marker in the middle of frame.
 * 2. **Draws to the video rectangle, not the view.** [FpvTextureView] letterboxes the image
 *    inside the view; projecting against view bounds shifts everything by the size of the bars.
 *    Same rect [CrosshairView] already uses, fed the same way.
 * 3. **Pitch sign.** DJI reports gimbal pitch negative when looking down; screen Y grows
 *    downward. Both conventions are handled once, in [project], rather than at each call site.
 *
 * Accuracy is bounded by gimbal bearing accuracy and by telemetry lagging the video — markers
 * will swim during fast gimbal movement. This is a "which of those buildings" tool, not a
 * survey instrument; the crosshair drop remains the precise one.
