 * blend case removed. In THIS tree the camera's live figure comes from its reported focal
 * length ([CameraFov]) for the visible lenses AND the thermal lens, and the overlay and the
 * `<sensor>` cone already read one accessor, so the two faults the Autel policy was written
 * for were never present here. What WAS present is the gap this closes: before the thermal
 * focal read has answered — or when the aircraft refuses it — the fallback was the calibrated
 * VISIBLE base, projected across a thermal picture about half as wide. The thermal constant
 * is the fallback for that lens now, as the visible calibration is for the visible one.
 *
 * Pure, no SDK import, so the choice is pinned by a unit test rather than by a flight.
