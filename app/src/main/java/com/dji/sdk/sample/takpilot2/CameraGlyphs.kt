/**
 * The still-camera and movie-camera symbols, in ONE place.
 *
 * ⚠ **TWO VIEWS DRAW THESE AND THEY MUST DRAW THE SAME SHAPE.** The HUD's media-mode readout
 * says which mode the camera is in; the toolbar's record pill becomes a shutter in that mode.
 * A pilot learns one symbol for "stills" and one for "video", and the two would drift apart
 * the first time either file was touched alone.
 *
 * Drawn as paths rather than shipped as vector drawables because both callers STROKE them twice
 * — a black or coloured outline pass and then the fill — so the glyph carries the same edge as
 * the text beside it and stays legible over bright ground. An ImageView cannot take that edge.
 *
 * Every dimension is a fraction of [size], so one symbol serves an 18sp readout and a 34dp pill.
