/**
 * Invisible landing pad for `USB_ACCESSORY_ATTACHED`. It shows nothing and finishes at once.
 *
 * R34: this filter used to sit on [TAKPilot2GoHomeActivity], which is `singleTask`. Delivering
 * the intent therefore brought Home forward and DESTROYED every activity above it — so a USB
 * event while the pilot was flying tore down the flight screen, and with it the drone's CoT
 * feed to TAK (`TakBridgeHolder.stop`), the team's video (`VideoStreamerHolder.stop`) and the
 * keep-awake flag, leaving the pilot to notice and tap back in. On an exported activity that
 * path is reachable by any app on the device, not only by real hardware.
 *
 * Home keeps `launchMode="singleTask"` — that is a specification MUST (UI spec §7, conformance
 * V10), and it exists so a forgotten intent flag cannot stack a second Home. The fix is to stop
 * pointing USB attach at Home, not to weaken the launch mode. `singleTop` would be WORSE: Home
 * is not on top during a flight, so the intent would build a second Home above the flight
 * screen — same teardown, plus the stacked Home the specification forbids.
 *
 * Structure follows DJI's own v5 sample (`UsbAttachActivity`, translucent, filter + accessory
 * meta-data moved off the launcher). Its BODY is deliberately not copied: the sample does
 * `NEW_TASK or CLEAR_TASK` back to main, which is precisely the teardown being fixed here.
 *
 * Nothing in this app reads the accessory payload — MSDK v5 handles attach internally once it
 * is initialised. This activity exists only so the framework has somewhere to deliver the
 * intent that is not the pilot's task stack.
