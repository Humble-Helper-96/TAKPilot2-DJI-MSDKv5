/**
 * Obstacle proximity drawn as arcs on the edges of the FPV, one per aircraft face.
 *
 * PORTED FROM THE AUTEL BUILD (`takpilot-autel_v1-2/.../tak/ObstacleEdgeView.kt`), which was
 * itself modelled on Autel Explorer after a wall strike. Keeping the visual language identical is
 * the point: the operator flies both aircraft, and an arc bowing in from the edge nearest the
 * obstacle must mean the same thing in both apps. Amber at moderate range, red when close,
 * distance printed on the arc.
 *
 * **Divergence from the Autel view, deliberate: forward is drawn here.** The Autel version omits
 * a front indicator on the reasoning that an obstacle dead ahead is already in the video. That
 * holds for the EVO II, which senses six ways and still has five indicators left. The Air 2S
 * senses forward, backward, up and down and has NO lateral sensors, so the same rule would leave
 * the display blank in the one direction the aircraft actually flies. Forward therefore gets a
 * readout — a captioned chevron pointing up-and-away, mirroring REAR, so the two read as a pair
 * and neither can be confused with the up/down arcs.
 *
 * **Up and down are bands on the top and bottom edges, NEAR ONLY** (operator, 2026-10-07:
 * "just show the indicator when it's very near"). The same wash as the sides, so an edge band
 * always means "the hazard is off that edge" and a chevron always means fore/aft; they start
 * at [VERT_NEAR_M], not [WARN_M], because the downward sensor reads the ground at every low
 * hover and the upward one reads a ceiling indoors — a 39 ft start would paint both edges for
 * most of a flight. The feed is the same millimetre contract as the ring.
 *
 * **Units need no assumption here.** DJI reports metres by API contract, unlike the Autel radar
 * whose centimetre scale had to be inferred and field-validated. Feet for display is one
 * conversion at the point of drawing.
 *
 * Draws inside the VISIBLE part of [videoRect] — since the 2026-10-07 fill-crop the rect can
 * overflow the view at the sides, and an arc drawn at a negative x is an arc nobody sees. The
 * video is pillarboxed to the left so the HUD
 * and mini-map can own the right strip, and an arc on the view's right edge would sit under the
 * instrument column instead of on the picture. Same rect [CrosshairView] uses.
