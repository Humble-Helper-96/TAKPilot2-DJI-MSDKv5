/**
 * Pins the SRT **READ** advertisement — the address the TEAM connects to, which is a different
 * leg from the SRT push that [VideoTransportUrlTest] covers.
 *
 * The formula is not ours to invent: it is recorded in `UAS_Apps/srt-cot-video-advertising.md`
 * from testing against a live MediaMTX and real clients on 2026-10-09. These tests exist
 * because every mistake available here fails the same invisible way the 2026-08-12 flight
 * did — the push is perfect, the server is happy, and every viewer gets nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ The companion rule, that `ConnectionEntry.path` must carry the whole query string, is
 * pinned in `CotBuilderTest` — a correct url with a wrong `path` still plays on nothing.
