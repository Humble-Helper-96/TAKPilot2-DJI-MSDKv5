/**
 * Pins the three addresses the video configuration produces.
 *
 * Every one of them fails INVISIBLY from the controller, which is why they are tested here and
 * not left to the bench:
 *
 *  - The PUSH address wrong: the stream never starts and the reason is at the server.
 *  - The ADVERTISED address wrong: the push is perfect and every viewer gets nothing. This is
 *    the failure that took a flight to find in 2026-08-12.
 *  - The MASKED address wrong: the one line a pilot reads to check the configuration lies.
 *
 * The SRT cases hold the shape the media server needs. The credentials are IN the stream id
 * there, which is also why the masking test below is a security control and not cosmetic.
