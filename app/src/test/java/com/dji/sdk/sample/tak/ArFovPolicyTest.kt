/**
 * The field the AR overlay projects with, per lens. Ported from the Autel tree's test of the
 * same name (faults 1 and 2 of the 2026-09-14 AR audit) without the PIP case: this tree has
 * no composite. What it pins here is that the thermal picture is projected with a THERMAL
 * field whether or not the camera has reported one, and that the vertical always derives
 * from the horizontal that is actually in use.
