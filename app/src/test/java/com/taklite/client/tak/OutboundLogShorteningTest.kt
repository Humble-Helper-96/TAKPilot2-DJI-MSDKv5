/**
 * Pins the shortening of the SECOND connection's outbound log line (v2.4.0, 2026-10-09).
 *
 * The split made every outbound CoT go out twice, and both copies logged the whole event.
 * Measured on the controller: `CoT OUT` was 30.7 % of a log file that filled 1 MB every 132 s,
 * and AppLog flushes synchronously on the calling thread every 8 KB — about once a second.
 * The elevated connection's line now names the difference instead of repeating the wire.
 *
 * ⚠ **THE POINT OF THESE TESTS IS THAT THE SHORTENING CANNOT HIDE A REAL DIFFERENCE.** The
 * two wires are allowed to differ by the `__video` block and by nothing else; anything else
 * must fall back to logging the full wire. A shortening that silently swallowed a changed
 * uid, callsign or position would make the log actively misleading, which is worse than the
 * duplication it replaced.
