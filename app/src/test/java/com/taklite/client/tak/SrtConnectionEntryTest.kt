/**
 * Pins the ONE fact that makes a CoT-advertised SRT feed playable in ATAK.
 *
 * From `UAS_Apps/srt-cot-video-advertising.md`, tested against a live TAK Server, a real
 * MediaMTX SRT listener and real clients on 2026-10-09:
 *
 * > For ATAK, put the whole query string — `?streamid=…&passphrase=…` — into
 * > `ConnectionEntry.path`, not just into `url=`.
 *
 * ⚠ **ATAK DOES NOT READ `url` FOR SRT.** It rebuilds the connection from `ConnectionEntry`
 * and its parser matches on the literal `?streamid=` text. Given a bare stream name, or the
 * streamid without that prefix, it hands an EMPTY stream id to its native SRT call; the
 * server answers `invalid stream ID ''` and the open fails instantly, every time. A test that
 * only checked `url` would pass while nothing played.
