# Notices

`LICENSE` is plain MIT and covers the TAKPilot2 code in this repository. It is kept
free of any other text so that automated licence detection reads it correctly. The
terms below sit alongside it; they do not modify it.

## What the MIT licence does NOT cover

**The DJI Mobile SDK V5 binaries.** This project builds against
`com.dji:dji-sdk-v5-aircraft` and `com.dji:dji-sdk-v5-aircraft-provided`, resolved
from Maven. They are not bundled in this repository and they are licensed separately
under DJI's End User License Agreement (https://developer.dji.com/policies/eula/).

**DJI's Sample Code.** This project is built on DJI's Mobile SDK for Android V5
sample application (https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-Android-V5), which DJI
releases under the MIT License. That original notice is preserved, as its terms
require, in `LICENSE-DJI-SAMPLE`.

**The vendored SRT client.** `app/src/main/java/com/pedro/srt/` and
`app/src/main/java/com/pedro/common/` are taken from RootEncoder (Copyright pedroSG94),
Apache License 2.0, tag `2.4.7` — https://github.com/pedroSG94/RootEncoder. `com/pedro/srt/`
is the whole `srt` module; `com/pedro/common/` holds the seven files that module uses. The
rest of `common` and the AV1 parser are not included.

It is source and not a dependency for one reason only: the byte-identical code flies on the
Autel sibling, where the toolchain cannot read the published aar at all. Changes, each marked
`TAKPILOT2 CHANGE` in the file:

- `SrtClient.latencyMs` is settable and goes into BOTH handshake delay fields. The library sent
  a fixed 120 ms as the receiver delay and hardcoded the sender delay to zero, so a publisher's
  value governed nothing and the server used its own default.
- `Constants.MTU` 1500 -> 1316. It sizes an outgoing packet and the library does not subtract
  the IP and UDP headers, so 1500 put 1360 bytes on the wire — larger than an ordinary path
  carries. `READ_BUFFER` keeps the receive path at 1500.
- `setAuthorization` threw a bare `TODO()`; it throws with a message saying where the
  credentials go. SRT has no user or password field.
- Seven enum files called `Enum.entries` and now call `values()`; `BitrateChecker` was Java and
  is Kotlin. Both are for the Autel sibling's older compiler and are harmless here.

**The vendored RTSP client.** `app/src/main/java/com/pedro/rtsp/` is taken from
rtmp-rtsp-stream-client-java (Copyright pedroSG94), licensed under the Apache License
2.0. Its notice is preserved, as that licence requires, in
`app/src/main/java/com/pedro/rtsp/NOTICE.txt`.

## This software commands an aircraft

It is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind, as `LICENSE` states, and no
release of it has been validated in flight at the time of writing. The operator of the
aircraft is responsible for the safety of the flight and for compliance with the
applicable aviation regulations.
