# Build, bump and install — the ONLY way a build should reach the controller.
#
# ⚠ EVERY INSTALL GETS A NEW versionCode, AND THAT IS THE POINT. On 2026-08-24 about a dozen
# builds went onto the controller all carrying versionCode 91, so `pm dumpsys` could not tell any
# of them apart and the operator had no way to know whether the aircraft was flying the build we
# had just fixed. `BUILD_TIME` did not help either: it is stamped in UTC during Gradle
# CONFIGURATION, so it reads a couple of minutes earlier than the APK and eight hours off a clock
# in Alaska. A build you cannot identify from the device is a build you cannot flight-test.
#
# It also verifies the install actually took. `adb install` can print "Performing Streamed
# Install" and then fail, and a half-read success message is how the wrong build gets flown.
#
# Usage:  tools/install.sh ["what this build is for"]
